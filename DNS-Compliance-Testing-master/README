                 DNS Compliance Testing

Provide tools to allow Registries and Registrars (amongst others) to
check the DNS protocol compliance of the servers they are delegating
zones to.

The first tool is 'genreport' which, by default, tests the EDNS compliance
of the delegated servers.  genreport can also be configured to test which
query types are also handled and other DNS protocol compliance issues.

Testing of servers is needed because every time some extension has
been used in the DNS, recursive server operators have discovered
non-compliant authoritative servers, which have to be worked around
to be able to return answers to the initiating client.

genreport tests both extension that are currently in use and the
handling of potential future extensions.

genreport is designed to be fast without overloading the delegated
servers.  e.g. it takes ~14 minutes to test every delegated server
from the .GOV zone.

genreport requires that libresolve / libbind be available (or be built
into the C library).

genreport requires OpenSSL to be available.

The man page for genreport provides a number of examples of how it can
be used.

When building from the git run the following command before following
INSTALL.  pkgconfig / pkg-config / pkgconf will also need to be installed
prior to running autoreconf.

		autoreconf -fvi
